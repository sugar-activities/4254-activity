  <p style='font-size:x-large'>Kandid is a system to evolve
  graphical forms.</p><br/>

  <p style='font-size:large'>Introduction</p>

  <p>In Kandid a population consist of images looking like abstract
  art or patterns. These graphical forms are not drawn by hand.
  Instead new forms can be found using an interactive genetic
  algorithm.</p><br/>

  <p>Kandid is a combination of image rendering algorithms, genetic
  programming and interactive aesthetic selection. The program is
  missing a fitness function, a component you normally expect in an
  artificial genetic system. The lack of the built in fitness
  function is done by concept. No mathematical algorithm can decide
  if a graphic is meaningful for the user. The fitness function in
  Kandid is replaced by human aesthetic selection. In other words:
  The user tolds the program which images are 'cool' or never seen
  before.</p><br/>

  <p style='font-size:large'>Usage</p>

  <ol>
    <li>You can start Kandid from your Home view by selecting Start
    new. The new image population starts with randomly generated
    images.<br/>

    </li>

    <li>An other possibility is starting Kandid with an existing
    image population. You can load a former image population from
    Home view or from the journal.<br/>
    <img src="file:../../intro/resume-favorite-colormap.png" /><br/>
    </li>

    <li>A randomly produced image population looks mostly very
    dull. Its only a starting point from where the image population
    can be evolved in subsequent generations.<br/>
    <img src="file:../../intro/random-population-colormap.png" /><br/>
    </li>

    <li>To evolve the new image population you must tell the program
    which images are interesting. There is a
    slider above every image. Use this slider to tell Kandid how
    aesthetic these images are. For an awfully bore image give 0 or
    1 point. For images not to bad you can give 5 or 6 points. Your
    favorites needs 8 or 9 points.<br/>
    <img src="file:../../intro/fitnes-slider-colormap.png" /><br/>
    </li>

    <li>Press the Random button and wait a few seconds. Some images
    will be replaced by other. You can
    repeat this for some rounds. Preserve interesting images by
    moving the slider to an value between 5 and 9 points. But the result is a little bit
    disappointing. Too much bore images. Finding good looking
    images is like finding a needle in an haystack.
    This is the point where evolution can help.
    <br/>
    </li>

    <li>Press the Breed button instead of the Random button and wait a few seconds.
    Again images with low ratings will be replaced by new images.
    But there is one difference. These new images are offsprings of your favorite images.
    This means that the offspring genes are build from crossing over two parental
    genes and additionally mutating this new gene.

    <br/>
    You can repeat this for a long run.
    Always marking the image you find most appealing with a high ranking
    and setting the images, that should not appear again in the next generation,
    with a low ranking.

    </li>
  </ol>
  <br/>

  <p style='font-size:large'>Collaboration</p>

  <p>Kandid supports collaboration by publishing a complete image population
  or by sharing the gene of single image.</p><br/>
 
  <ol>
    <li>A new image population starts in private mode. To share it select
    'My Neighborhood'.
    <br/><img src="file:../../intro/neighborhood-colormap.png" /><br/>
    </li>

    <li>You can invite an other buddy to Kandid.
    If this buddy joins, your population will be send to your friends computer.
    Let explain this in detail: The gene of each image is send,
    not a bitmap of the image.
    In this way your friend can evolve an independent copy of your image population.
    I suppose your friend has an different aesthetic feeling.
    And after a few generations both populations will evolve in different directions.
    <br/>
    </li>

    <li>These separated populations can share images by sending 
    the gene of a single image to all friends. Above all images in your population you find
    a pull down menu. Selecting 'Publish to my friends' will send the 
    gene of this image it to all joined friends.
    <br/><img src="file:../../intro/publish-protozoon-colormap.png" /><br/>
    </li>
    
    <li>Image genes send from friends will be first displayed in a separate box.
    You find this incoming box on the left side.
    If you accept an incoming image, its gene will replace one of the low rated genes
    in your population.
    An other possibility is to decline or to ignore an incoming image.
    Here you see white and pink colored images send from a friend.
    Maybe he prefers bright color. It is your decision to integrate these
    to your 'earth tones' image population or just to ignore it.
